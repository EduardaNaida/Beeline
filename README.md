# Beeline

_Be in line, online_

Beeline is a small project that aims to reduce crowding caused by queuing.
It achieves this by providing simple web interface that dispenses digital
queue-tickets and notifies the user when it is their turn. Additional
functionality is the ability to limit the number of people in a building
by counting and creating a queue when a building becomes full.
